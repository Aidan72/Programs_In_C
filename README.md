# Programs_In_C
A bunch of mini programs I've built using the legendary C language

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am an undergraduate student in cyberoperations, the C language is raw and powerful and 
goes hand in hand with assembly quite well. This program I am apart of strictly utilizes low level systems programming 
languages to incorporate a good foundation in reverse engineering and malware development.
